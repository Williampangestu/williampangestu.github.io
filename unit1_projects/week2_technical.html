		<h2>Inline vs Inline Block</h2>

		<p><span>Inline Block:</span> Any elements that comes in as a block (divs, paragraph, headers) will automatically take up the full width of the page, regardless of how much or how little content you put in. However, Inline Block makes an element a block box with height and width while also allowing other elements to sit next to it on the same line, as shown in the picture below.</p>

		<p><span>Inline:</span> Similar to Inline Block, Inline makes the element sit on the same line as another element, but without formatting it like a block. It only takes up as much width as it needs. As you can see on the left picture below, all the "divs" got squished to the smallest possible width because they do not maintain their dimensions. An element with display: inline cannot have a height, width, or a vertical margin. </p>
