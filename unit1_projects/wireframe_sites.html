		<h1>Quirky</h1>
		<p>This website act as an alternative to crowd-funding sites such as kickstarter. It acts as an innovation platform that allows for invention idea suggestions by their users and viewed and voted upon the rest of the invention "community". If Quirky is able to generate enough retailer interest, they bring the product to market in partnership with the original inventor. Moreover, people can also buy the innovative products that they like on this website. The website is pretty organized, it has a self-explanatory navigation button to help people navigate through the website without confusing themselves.</p><br/>

		<h1>Yahoo</h1>
		<p>This website brings together a lot of information about the recent world news. It also has a navigation sidebar that sort news by category such as food, travel, weather, sports, autos, etc. I think the website is a litte crowded, so it might be overwhelming for people that are not used to the website.</p><br/>

		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>This website provides the latest news, videos, and pictures about soccer teams, games, and players. Eventhough it is pretty organized and has a big and clear navigation button. I found it pretty overwhelming for the new user because it combines a lot of pictures and text.</p><br/>
