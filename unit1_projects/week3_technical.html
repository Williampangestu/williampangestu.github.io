		<h2>Why Javascript is so popular in web development?</h2>

		<p><img src="images/javascript.png"/>JavaScript is one of the most important dynamic web languages to date. It is everywhere we go on the web, from logging into G-mail, reserve our flight at expedia, to annoying pop-up windows, JavaScript has become an integral part of our browsing experience. Brendan Eich from Netscape developed JavaScript in the 90's. It was initially called Mocha, then renamed to Livescript, then finally becoming what we know it today by JavaScript. It was a hot language that quickly became popular, and eventually became an integral part of the web browser, which is a large reason why the language remains so powerful and popular today. JavaScript is built into and widely standardized across all common web browsers, making it easy for developers and users to implement. It is as simply read as HTML and does not require any download. Also, it is a scripting programming language so the code we write does not need to be compiled and does not require a compiler or any other expensive software to write. JavaScript is just plain text, so all we need to write it is notepad or any other plain text editor. Moreover, Javascripts most common usage is to write actions into HTML that create visual animations and behaviors in a web browser, thus enhancing the web experience that static HTML offers. Although it is primarily web based, it is also used for widgets, desktop applications, and PDF actions.</p>
