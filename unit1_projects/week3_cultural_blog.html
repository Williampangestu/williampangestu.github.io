		<p id="ques">What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC?</p>
		<p> In his video, Shereef Bishay descibes the difference between the traditional learning environment and Dev Bootcamp. He discussed how traditional education is sort of like serving a meal to students, they are just being fed without really knowing the process behind it. On the other hand, Dev Bootcamp encourages their students to be the chef in the kitchen. Using all the given resources, we can all work together and help each other as a team. Moreover, I am also impressed with DBC's method of teaching their students important skills on how to learn things on their own and how to bring passion into it. Instead of holding your hand and guiding you step by step on how to program using one specific language.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p>
		<p> I hope that I can have a good interaction with other students because I realize that I will not achieve great things by doing it just by myself. Also, in this environment, I feel like I don't have to be scared to ask for help if I don't understand something. I believe that we are all a part of the collaborative and supportive culture at DBC where we can help, inspire, and encourage each other. 

		</p>

		<p id="ques">Have your expectations of DBC changed?</p>
		<p> Definitely! At first, I thought that we were just going to learn how to do programming without much interaction with other students. However I was wrong, besides programming, DBC also have a strong emphasis on engineering empathy, pair programming, and team building environment.

		</p>

		<p id="ques">Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>
		<p> I am a little bit nervous thinking about all the works that I have to do when the program starts. However, I believe that my hardwork, commitment, and dedication will pay off at the end. Also, since I spent almost my whole life learning in the traditional education environment, I am thrilled and really excited to participate in DBC learning environment. I am looking forward to the new and different experience in DBC, which I believe will make me the best developer I can be.
