		<p id="title">Women in Tech</p>
		<p class ="big"> <img src="images/women.jpg"/> The lack of women in the tech industry, both in the trenches and at the top, has been well reported. And there are far too many examples of harassment, sexual and otherwise, directed at the few women in the industry. However, what has been often overlooked is the equally troubling issue of what happens when qualified women actually land a job in tech: Many don't stick around. In fact, women leave tech companies at twice the rate of men, according to the Center for Talent Innovation. They report being frustrated about their lack of advancement, the long hours and the lack of flexibility. But many who bail, say they do so because they didn't like the company's culture, their boss or their co-workers. The problem is that while people at the company said they wanted to hire more women, they didn't follow through in making women feel more welcome in the workplace. In addition, the other difficulties with keeping women in technology is that there are few female mentors for them to look to. Without women to look to at the top, many women in tech fields get discouraged and leave the workforce.

		<p class="big">Some companies have been working to break through the gender divide. Recently, 24 firms, including Google, Yahoo and eBay, submitted their internal data to the Anita Borg Institute for an assessment of how well they were doing recruiting, retaining and advancing female technologists. For the most part, companies know what they have to do. Promoting women within the organization appears to be effective in changing the corporate culture to be more inclusive of women. But simple things matter too, like checking in with women about how they are doing, and not just listening to their concerns but making changes based on their observations. Moreover, I also think that it is important for companies to add mentoring component to their programs. The mentorship program is not only helping women network with upper-management women in tech fields, but also providing confidence that may have waned over the years.
