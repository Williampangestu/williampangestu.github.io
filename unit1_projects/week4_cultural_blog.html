		<p id="ques">Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</p>
		<p> The last time I had an emotional conflict with someone is when I fought with my sister when I was in highschool. At that time, she was a college student at UCLA and she came back to my country for summer break. On her 22nd birthday, my parents were working out of town so there's only me and her at the house. She asked me to accompany her for a lunch to kinda celebrate her birthday. However, the whole time I was with her, I was in a bad mood and reluctant to talk to her. She tried to talk to me and asked me repeteadly what is wrong with me but I still would not talk to her. She was really upset and dissapointed with me and eventually stopped talking to me that day.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">What was the source of the conflict?</p>
		<p> The night before her birthday, I just got a rejection email from UCLA and I felt really embarassed and upset with myself.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">How did you handle that conflict?</p>
		<p> I handled the conflict with my sister by running away from the problem and isolating myself.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</p>
		<p> It made the conflict worse because I felt like I ruined her special day by doing that. At that time, I was her only family that she can celebrate her birthday with and I blew it.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</p>
		<p> If I could go back, I would tell my sister that I got rejected from UCLA. She would definitely cheer me up and make me feel better. If I did that, we would both be happy and my sister could have a much better birthday celebration.
		</p>

		<p id="ques">What did you learn from this experience?</p>
		<p> I learnt that I have to be more open, especially with my own family. Instead of running away and isolating myself with my own problems, its always better to share them with my friends and family. They will definitely try to cheer me up and help me find solutions to my problem.
