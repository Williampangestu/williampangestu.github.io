		<p><span>Quirky:</span> This website act as an alternative to crowd-funding sites such as kickstarter. It acts as an innovation platform that allows for invention idea suggestions by their users and viewed and voted upon the rest of the invention "community". If Quirky is able to generate enough retailer interest, they bring the product to market in partnership with the original inventor. Moreover, people can also buy the innovative products that they like on this website. This is one of my favorite websites because I like to see some innovative stuffs that people make. It helps inspire me to make something useful yet unique and creative. I think the most important part of the website that draw my eyes is the navigation sidebar and the content area where it has all the picture of the products. Visually, the website is well organized, elegant and simple, which make it easy to navigate through. I have also bought a couple of cool things on this website. </p><br/>

		<p><span>Yahoo:</span> This websites provides the latest world news. The area that draw my eyes is the box on the top of the page that has all kind of news. I like it because it combines all type of news such as sports, autos, weather, technology, etc. so I dont have to read them by category. The color of the website is easy on eyes and pretty. However, I think it is a little bit cluttered with the combination of text and pictures. Moreover, it is quite easy to browse the content of the site due to the big and clear navigation sidebar. </p><br/>

		<p><span>Goal:</span> This website provides the current news and videos about soccer games and players. Visually, the website is a pretty hectic because it combines a lot of pictures, text, and videos. However, it has a big and clear navigation bar on the top of the page, which makes it easy to navigate through all the content of the site</p><br/>
