		<p id="question">The values that come to my mind when I think of the times in my life where you've been happiest, the proudest, and most satisfied</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adventure</li>
			<li>Challenge</li>
			<li>Compassion</li>
			<li>Friendship</li>
			<li>Having a family</li>
			<li>Helping other people</li>
			<li>Honesty</li>
			<li>Introspection</li>
			<li>Persistance</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Persistence is important in life because it helps me know what I want and focus on achieving it. I think the ability to hold on or to get back up after we have been knocked down is essential to achieve any real success. There will be failures along the way and its how we deal with these failures that will determine the outcome of any endeavour that we undertake.</p><br/>

		<p>In general, I try to live up to these values</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adventure: 4</li>
			<li>Challenge: 4</li>
			<li>Compassion: 5</li>
			<li>Friendship: 5</li>
			<li>Having a family: 5</li>
			<li>Helping other people: 5</li>
			<li>Honesty: 5</li>
			<li>Introspection: 4</li>
			<li>Persistance: 5</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice was about whether or not he should lie to his parents about all the money he lost from gambling. I told him that he should definitely tell his parents and stop gambling because if he does not stop now, it will ruin his life in the future.
